// Package bundle resolves the directories holding witness's bundled runtime
// assets — the embedding model (assets/e5-small) and the prompt/lens templates
// (prompts/). These ship ALONGSIDE the binary, not in the per-user data dir, so
// their location depends on how witness was launched, not on WITNESS_HOME.
//
// This exists because the Unix hook shim (hooks/witness.sh) used to be the only
// thing that located the assets: it exports CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT computed from its
// own path. A Windows exec-form hook has no shell to run the shim, so the binary
// must self-locate. Dir() adds an exe-relative probe that works with no env at
// all, which is strictly better than the old CWD-relative fallback (that only
// worked when the process happened to start in the repo root).

// Dir resolves the on-disk directory for a bundled asset subtree. subdir is the

// "e5-small")). envOverride, when non-empty, names an env var checked first that
// points DIRECTLY at the resolved dir (e.g. WITNESS_PROMPTS, WITNESS_ASSETS).
//
// Resolution order, first hit wins:
//  1. $envOverride, if set — an explicit, fully-resolved override.
//  2. $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/subdir — set by Claude Code when witness runs as a
//     plugin, and by the Unix hook shim for a working-copy install.
//  3. exe-relative: the first of <exeDir>/subdir or <exeDir>/../subdir that
//     exists. This covers both an installed layout (witness + assets/ siblings)
//     and the build layout (bin/witness-os-arch under the repo, assets/ one up).
//     Windows exec-form hooks rely on this — nothing sets CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT.
//  4. subdir, CWD-relative — the last-resort dev fallback (preserves the old
//     behavior so error messages/tests that ran from the repo root still work).
